      Please <a href="index.html">go back</a> to the main website, though. I would like to believe that it is informative. It also takes less than 10 minutes to read. Are you really <b>so</b> busy that you can't read something for a few minutes? You most certainly aren't. My bet is that, living in this digital age, you avoid anything pertaining to reading, and only do things like watch Netflix in your free time. Netflix is cool and all, but so is reading. Read my website because I highly doubt you have anything "cooler" to do.
