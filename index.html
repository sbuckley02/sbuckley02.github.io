    <h1> What is 0 to the 0th power? </h1>
    <p>
    A burning question that has divided mathematicians for years is finally answered by me, Stephen Buckley: a high school student definitely not qualified to prove mathematical concepts.

    <h2>
      What could 0<sup>0</sup> possibly be?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are only two possible numerical values for 0<sup>0</sup>, 0 and 1. The <a href="https://medium.com/i-math/the-zero-power-rule-explained-449b4bd6934d">Zero Power Rule</a> states that any number raised to the 0th power is 1. It is also common knowledge that 0 raised to any power is 0. From these rules, it is clear that 0<sup>0</sup> will not produce any number (if any) that is not 0 or 1. However, 0<sup>0</sup> doesn't have to be a number, as it could be undefined. Many expressions are undefined, such as 1 divided by 0, or the natural log of 0.
    </p>
    <h2> <br>
      Is 0<sup>0</sup> = 1?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If 0<sup>0</sup> = 1, then you can reasonably assume that 0<sup>x</sup> = 1 will produce an x value of 0. Let's test this:
      <br> 0<sup>x</sup> = 1
      <br> ln(0<sup>x</sup>) = ln(1)
      <br> ln(0)x = ln(1)
      <br> x = ln(1) / ln(0)
      <br> x = 0 / undefined
    </p>
    <p>
      We come across a problem here. The natural log of 0 is undefined, as shown below:
      <br> log<sub>e</sub>0 = z
      <br> e<sup>z</sup> = 0
      <br> There is no power of e that will produce 0, so the natural log of 0 is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the test produced an undefined expression in the denominator, we can reasonably conclude that no power of 0 will produce 1. Therefore, 0<sup>0</sup> ≠ 1.
    </p>
      <h2> <br>
        Is 0<sup>0</sup> = 0?
    </h2>
    <p>
    0 is special. It is neither positive nor negative. Therefore, you can treat it either as a positive number or a negative number without affecting the results of your calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can say that 0 = +0 = -0 
      <br> Therefore, we can say that 0<sup>+0</sup> = 0<sup>-0</sup>
      <br> Remember the rule for negative exponents: x<sup>-y</sup> = 1/(x<sup>y</sup>)
      <br> Plugging in 0, we get 0<sup>-0</sup> = 1/(0<sup>+0</sup>)
      <br> This simplifies to 0<sup>0</sup> = 1/(0<sup>0</sup>)
      <br> Assuming that 0<sup>0</sup> = 0, using substitution we get 0 = 1/0 <br>
      1/0 is undefined, so we get 0 = undefined. 0 is clearly a defined number, so this is plain wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 0<sup>0</sup> to equal 0, both 0<sup>+0</sup> and 0<sup>-0</sup> must produce 0. This is not the case, so 0<sup>0</sup> ≠ 0.
    </p>
    <h2> <br>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      As previously mentioned, 0<sup>0</sup> can only be three values: 0, 1, or undefined. I have thoroughly disproved 0 and 1 as possibilities, so it is clear that 0<sup>0</sup> is undefined.
      <br> In my mind, this is perfectly normal. Look at the table below (DNE = Does Not Exist):
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th> x </th> <th> f(x) = 0<sup>x</sup> </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> -2 </td> <td> DNE </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> -1 </td> <td> DNE </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 0 </td> <td> DNE </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 0.25 </td> <td> 0 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 0.5 </td> <td> 0 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 2 </td> <td> 0 </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      If 0 to any negative power is undefined, why can't 0 to the 0th power be undefined? (Hint: It can) <br>
      Think logically for a second. If you have the number 0 and the exponent it's raised to is 0, how would a result of 1 make any sense? The answer: it doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasonable conclusion to make out of all of this is simply that f(x) = 0<sup>x</sup> only exists for the domain x = (0, ∞), with 0<sup>0</sup> not existing.
